This is the beginning of what I hope to be a complete interactive county-level mapping website covering the entire United States. Many websites contain interactive maps but few contain comprehensive data covering a variety of topics, including presidential elections and Census data (commute paterns, population demographics, etc).  This will be a one-stop shop for this type of interactive mapping data.

The user will have the ability to choose what dataset they want to see visualized (in both map and chart form). Each object on the map will have interactive elements in the form of pop-up information.

As a proof of concept, below are screenshots of three maps using the following datasets: 'Election 2012', 'Census 2010', and 'Race 2010'.

Election 2012:
